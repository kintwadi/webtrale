% are different on all of its subtypes, then inequations are added to A.

% According to Gerald working with this on, type inference is NP complete.
% Makes the system slower at compile time and run time.

% Strangely enough this affects sentences with coordination. With subtype covering on

% The same for Danish: Bjarne sp√∏rger hvem der kommer og synger.

% ALE never had support for "unfilling", at least in one reading of that term,
% until now.
%   But now it does.  We're not going to call it unfilling ,however, because
% that term has been so molested that it's going to confuse everyone.  We'll
% call it "sparse output."
%   To turn this on, use ale_flag(sparseoutput,_,on).
